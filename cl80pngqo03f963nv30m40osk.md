## 5 Chrome/Edge extensions every Developer should have..!!

Did you know the new Microsoft edge is based on **chromium ** and it supports all of the chrome extensions as well as all the legacy edge extensions??

### What is Chromium?
According to Wikipedia, Chromium is a free and open-source web browser project, mainly developed and maintained by Google. This codebase provides the vast majority of code for the Google Chrome browser, which is proprietary software and has some additional features.

Not just Microsoft Edge;  Samsung Internet, Opera, and many other browsers are based on the Chromium code. *Isn't that interesting?*

Using a browser comes with its pros and cons, But knowing that two browsers can support the same set of extensions, can be a deal-breaker.

But In this blog, we are not going to do a comparison of which browser is better than the other, instead, we are going to talk about some of the most important browser extensions that I have been using for a long time now and it has been very helpful in my day-to-day life. 

Let's get started..!!

### 1. [AdBlock Plus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock-plus-free-ad-bloc/cfhdojbkjhnklbpkdaibdccddilifddb)
Let's admit it, All those ads popping up on our favorite websites can be annoying. They tend to appear in all unwanted places and spoil the browsing experience.

AdBlock Plus has a **4.5 Star rating** and more than **10 Million users** and has support for the below features.
-  It can Block annoying video ads, pop-ups, and banners from any website.
-  It can Stop tracking by websites and give you more privacy
-  It blocks off destructive malvertising that can hide in ads
-  It also gives you faster browsing (as resources are blocked from loading)

### 2.[Grammarly](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammarly-grammar-checker/kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen)
Even the best writers need an editor and reviewers to verify and correct their work. We as developers are no Shakespeare, and we do make a lot of errors while writing.

Writing those long-ass emails and extensive blogs can have and will have its share of spelling and grammatical errors. 

With a **4.5 Star Rating** and more than **10 Million Users** Grammarly is winning the game of autocorrect.

Even the Free version of it is quite powerful and comes in handy.

### 3.[Daily.Dev](https://daily.dev/)
Daily Dev is the fastest-growing online community for developers to stay updated on the best developer news. It brings the content you love in one place sourced from 400+ sources.

### 4. [WhatFont](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/whatfont/jabopobgcpjmedljpbcaablpmlmfcogm)

Inspecting an element from developer tools to find the font being used in the website is pretty cool, But you know what's even cooler? Finding the fonts just by hovering over the element. Simple and elegant. 

Whatfont has a **4 Star Rating** and more than **2 Million Users** and it can also detect the services used for serving the web fonts. It currently supports Typekit and Google Font API.

### 5. [ColorZilla](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colorzilla/bhlhnicpbhignbdhedgjhgdocnmhomnp)
ColorZilla, was originally developed as a Firefox developer extension and has more than 5 Million downloads there. It's now available as a chrome extension. You can use colorzilla as a Color Picker, Eyedropper, and Gradient Generator.

With ColorZilla you can get a color reading from any point in your browser, Even from Images.

Colorzilla has a **4.5 Star Rating** and more than **3 Million Users**. It seems like Colozilla is picking up on the chrome store.

*The Question may arise that why didn't I share the Microsoft store link in my blog, i.e. because You can download the extension from the chrome store and still install and launch it from your Microsoft Edge browser.*
