**Did you know that on an average, smartphone users touch their phones 2,617 times each day?**

With increasing mobile usage the average number of internet searches from mobile devices has also increased. A whopping 33% of electronic device users use their smartphone as their primary device for internet use.

**But are these mobile websites fast enough??**

Let’s see the current scenario is -

On an average it takes a whooping 214 server requests per mobile page.

19 Sec is the average page load time of mobile websites.

77% of these mobile sites take more than 10 seconds to load on a 3G network.

**So what can we do to have high performance website loading on mobile phones?**

One of the ways is what Google has come up with a solution to enhance our mobile search experience by launching The [AMP](https://www.ampproject.org/) Project or The Accelerated Mobile pages.

**What is AMP?**

An average AMP page takes 0.7 second to load. This is Google’s answer to Facebook’s instant articles.AMP websites are pretty easy to build. You can start developing your own AMP Page in just five minutes.
